Several internet protocols extend or build upon UDP (User Datagram Protocol) to add reliability, security, or additional features. Here are some key ones:

1. QUIC (Quick UDP Internet Connections)
	•	Developed by Google, now standardized by IETF.
	•	Provides reliability, multiplexing, and encryption (TLS 1.3) over UDP.
	•	Used in HTTP/3 for faster web performance.

2. DTLS (Datagram Transport Layer Security)
	•	A UDP-based counterpart of TLS for encrypted, secure communication.
	•	Used in VoIP (SIP, WebRTC), VPNs (OpenVPN), and IoT protocols (CoAP, LwM2M).

3. RTP (Real-time Transport Protocol)
	•	Used for streaming audio and video over UDP.
	•	Often paired with RTCP (RTP Control Protocol) for QoS monitoring.
	•	Used in VoIP, WebRTC, and video conferencing (Zoom, Teams, etc.)

4. SCTP (Stream Control Transmission Protocol) over UDP (SCTP-UDP encapsulation)
	•	Adds TCP-like reliability while using UDP for NAT traversal.
	•	Used in telecom signaling (Diameter, 5G core network protocols).

5. CoAP (Constrained Application Protocol)
	•	Lightweight IoT protocol designed for constrained devices.
	•	Uses DTLS for security and supports RESTful communication like HTTP.

6. TFTP (Trivial File Transfer Protocol)
	•	A simplified version of FTP that runs over UDP (port 69).
	•	Used for network booting, firmware updates, and device provisioning.

7. LDP (Label Distribution Protocol) over UDP
	•	Used in MPLS (Multiprotocol Label Switching) networks to establish label-switched paths.

8. DNS (Domain Name System) over UDP
	•	Standard protocol for domain name resolution.
	•	Can fall back to TCP for large responses.
	•	Variants: DoH (DNS over HTTPS) and DoT (DNS over TLS) for security.



Several internet protocols extend or build upon TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) to provide additional functionalities. Here are some key ones:

1. TLS (Transport Layer Security) / SSL (Secure Sockets Layer)
	•	Encrypts TCP connections to ensure confidentiality, integrity, and authentication.
	•	Used in HTTPS, FTPS, SMTPS, etc.

2. SCTP (Stream Control Transmission Protocol)
	•	Enhances TCP by supporting multiple streams within a connection to prevent head-of-line blocking.
	•	Used in telecom signaling and certain real-time applications.

3. MPTCP (Multipath TCP)
	•	Allows multiple paths for a single TCP connection to increase reliability and throughput.
	•	Useful in mobile networks where devices can use both Wi-Fi and LTE simultaneously.

4. QUIC (Quick UDP Internet Connections) over TCP (deprecated concept)
	•	Originally explored as a TCP extension but later evolved into a UDP-based protocol.
	•	Google’s early versions experimented with TCP before fully moving to UDP.

5. BGP (Border Gateway Protocol) over TCP
	•	BGP itself is an application-layer protocol but relies on TCP (port 179) for reliable session establishment between routers.

6. SMB (Server Message Block) over TCP
	•	Used for file sharing and network communication in Windows environments.
	•	Runs over TCP (port 445).

7. FTP (File Transfer Protocol) over TCP
	•	Uses two TCP connections: control (port 21) and data (varies)
